# BlazePHP

Welcome to BlazePHP, BlazePHP is inspired by my old framework
[FluxPHP](https://github.com/fluxphp-dev/fluxphp), I discontinued the FluxPHP framework, cause it's not really good framework tho. 
I build BlazePHP with new code and some old code from [FluxPHP](https://github.com/fluxphp-dev/fluxphp). the code from [FluxPHP](https://github.com/fluxphp-dev/fluxphp) is still reusable, but the full code was too chaotic,
now back to BlazePHP let's get started to the installation process

### Installation

```shell
composer create-project blazephp/blaze my-blaze-app
```
